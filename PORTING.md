# PORTING.md

A living roadmap for the Java → Go port of the RuneScape 2 (rev #225) client.

This document tracks **what is incomplete** in the port and the **order in
which the remaining work should be tackled**. It is updated as work lands.
Cross-reference with `README.md` (translation conventions) and `CLAUDE.md`
(architecture overview).

## 1. References

| Repo | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Java client | `$HOME/Code/github.com/LostCityRS/Client-Java` (branch `225-clean`) | **Authoritative source** for translation. Every Go change should map to a Java function. |
| TypeScript client | `$HOME/Code/github.com/LostCityRS/Client-TS` | Secondary cross-check for ambiguous Java → Go translations. |
| Go server | `$HOME/Code/github.com/zsrv/goscape` | **Reference only**, no code reuse. Useful as a third source of truth for the wire protocol (it is the server side of `ClientStream`). |

## 2. Porting Philosophy

These rules govern how to decide between "faithful translation" and "idiomatic
Go" when they conflict:

1. **Faithful 1:1 translation is the default.** Preserve Java function names,
   parameter order, control flow, and even apparent oddities (e.g. `var7` style
   locals translated to `var7` in Go). The goal is that any Java line should
   map to a small, identifiable region of Go code so behavior bugs can be
   diff-checked against the reference.
2. **Adapt to Go's type system rigorously.** Apply the conversions documented
   in `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` (`byte → int8`, etc.). Use parentheses where
   Java/Go operator precedence differs.
3. **Replace Java idioms with Go equivalents only when there is no other
   option:**
    - `synchronized` blocks → `sync.Mutex` only where state is actually shared
      across goroutines. Many `synchronized` methods in Java existed for
      defensive reasons that don't apply here. Annotate the choice with a
      comment referencing the Java source.
    - `Thread.start` / `Runnable` → `go func()` goroutine. Where Java does
      `shell.startThread(this, 2)` the Go side calls the equivalent run-loop
      method in a goroutine directly.
    - `try/catch` → idiomatic Go error handling, but only at boundaries where
      the Java code actually relies on the exception flow. Many translated
      `// TODO: try/catch` markers are vestigial and can be deleted with a
      one-line comment explaining why.
    - `Applet` API and `signlink.mainapp` checks → no-op, since the Go client
      is always a standalone binary.
4. **Don't refactor opportunistically.** No renaming, no extracting helpers,
   no replacing `Packet` with a more idiomatic buffer, no folding global
   `var` blocks into structs. Faithful structure is more valuable than
   incremental cleanliness while the port is still in progress.
5. **No code reuse from `goscape` (server).** Read it for protocol cross-checks,
   but do not import or copy. The server is a clean-sheet rewrite with a
   different architecture; mixing them now would obscure the Java mapping and
   couple two repositories that should evolve independently.

When in doubt, write the literal translation and leave a `// TODO: verify`
comment.

## 3. Build & Test

Per `CLAUDE.local.md`, all Go commands run with explicit temp dirs:

```bash
TMPDIR=/tmp/claude-1000 GOCACHE=/tmp/claude-1000/go-cache go build ./...
TMPDIR=/tmp/claude-1000 GOCACHE=/tmp/claude-1000/go-cache go test ./...
```

Git commits use `git commit --no-gpg-sign` (per global `CLAUDE.md`), and
because the GPG agent is sandboxed read-only, commits often have to be made
from a terminal outside Claude Code.

## 4. Gap Inventory

Severity legend:
- **🔴 blocker** — prevents a core gameplay flow (connecting, logging in,
  rendering the world).
- **🟡 important** — degrades a feature or correctness but the game can still
  reach a playable state without it.
- **⚪ cosmetic** — applet-only code, dead code, error-reporting niceties, or
  pure verification-style TODOs left over from the translation pass.

### 4.1 Whole files / packages missing

| Java source | Expected Go location | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~`jagex2/io/ClientStream.java` (182 lines)~~ | ~~`pkg/jagex2/io/clientstream/clientstream.go`~~ | ~~🔴~~ | ~~TCP socket wrapper with buffered writer goroutine. Required by login and every in-game packet. See §5.1.~~ **Ported 2026-05-21.** |
| `jagex2/datastruct/HashTable.java` (47 lines) | `pkg/jagex2/datastruct/hashtable/hashtable.go` | 🟡 | Hash bucket used by several config/entity systems. Currently unported; absence may be masked by callers that haven't been ported either. |
| ~~`sign/signlink.java` `opensocket` (lines 279–291)~~ | ~~`pkg/sign/signlink/signlink.go` (in `Run()` loop + new `OpenSocket` func)~~ | ~~🔴~~ | ~~Function entirely stubbed (line 215 `// TODO: OpenSocket`). See §5.2.~~ **Ported 2026-05-21.** Direct `net.DialTimeout` (skipped the polling pattern); `SocketReq` global and `Run()` branch removed. |
| `jagex2/client/ViewBox.java` | `pkg/jagex2/client/viewbox.go` (14 lines, empty) | 🟡 | Stub struct only. AWT-derived; may be replaceable by a tiny Gio adapter rather than a literal port. |

Note: `deob/client.java` (10,643 lines) and `deob/ObfuscatedName.java` are
**not missing** — the deobfuscated client moved into `pkg/jagex2/client/client.go`
during the merge documented in commit `e136d42`, and `ObfuscatedName` is a Java
annotation with no runtime equivalent in Go.

### 4.2 Networking gaps in `pkg/jagex2/client/client.go`

All blockers in this section depend on §5.1 (ClientStream port) and §5.2
(`signlink.OpenSocket`) landing first.

| Line | Function | Gap | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 483 | `Client` struct | `//Stream ClientStream // TODO` — field commented out. | 🔴 |
| 4865 | `GetHost` | Returns hardcoded `"127.0.0.1"`. Should resolve from codebase / args. | 🔴 |
| 6178 | `LoginFunc` | `// TODO: clientstream` — `c.stream = new ClientStream(...)` not wired. | 🔴 |
| 6214 | `LoginFunc` | `// TODO: stream.write` — login handshake bytes never sent. | 🔴 |
| 6215 | `LoginFunc` | `var7 := 0 // TODO: placeholder - var7 stream.read` — login response not read. | 🔴 |
| 6497 | `Unload` | `// TODO: stream.close` — leaks the socket on shutdown. | 🟡 |
| ~~6615~~ | ~~(commented)~~ | ~~`//func (c *Client) OpenSocket(arg0 int)` — function not written.~~ **Ported 2026-05-21.** | ~~🔴~~ |
| 6938 | (heartbeat write) | `// TODO: stream write` — periodic write not connected. | 🔴 |
| 7761 | `TryReconnect` | `// TODO: c.stream` — local `var2 = this.stream` save before reconnect. | 🟡 |
| 7767 | `TryReconnect` | `// TODO: c.stream.close()` — close pre-existing stream before retry. | 🟡 |
| 8623 | `Read` | Entire function is `return false // TODO: stub - c.stream`. This is the main inbound packet dispatcher (~100 lines in Java). | 🔴 |
| 3362–3363 | `Logout` | `// TODO: c.Stream.Close()`, `// TODO: c.Stream = nil`. | 🟡 |

### 4.3 Other client.go gaps

| Line | Function | Gap | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 595 | `Client` struct | `//MidiSync: // TODO` — field still commented. | 🟡 |
| 656 | `SetMidi` | `// TODO: synchronized` — likely needs a small `sync.Mutex` for the MIDI-loader handoff (single producer / consumer, so a channel may be cleaner). | 🟡 |
| 1533 | (MIDI run loop) | `// TODO: synchronized` — same handoff. | 🟡 |
| 1544 | (MIDI download) | `int(crc32.ChecksumIEEE(...)) // TODO: verify conversion` — verify against Java `CRC32.getValue()`. | ⚪ |
| 1558 | (MIDI download) | `var15.ReadAt(...)` semantics differ from Java `RandomAccessFile.read`; verify. | 🟡 |
| 1617, 1643, 1650, 1652, 1669 | `DrawFlames` | Pixel buffer copy/draw operations marked `// TODO: verify`. Visible flicker is the symptom if wrong. | 🟡 |
| 2450 | `GetJagFile` | CRC32 conversion `// TODO: verify`. | ⚪ |
| 2451 | `GetJagFile` | `// TODO: anything missing here?` — sanity check vs. Java needed. | 🟡 |
| 2460 | `GetJagFile` | `// TODO: try/except` — IO error from HTTP download. | 🟡 |
| 2741 | (minimap related) | `// TODO: GetBaseComponent()` — helper unported. | 🟡 |
| 3000 | (background loader) | `// TODO: startThread` — single goroutine spawn, low risk. | 🟡 |
| 3283, 3288 | `DrawTitleScreen` | `// TODO: verify` — title rendering parity. | ⚪ |
| 5310–5311 | `Load` | `//c.startthread(this, 2)` / `go c.Run()` — MIDI run-loop thread launch idiom. | ⚪ |
| 5354–5355 | `Load` | `// TODO: try/except - recover panic?` and `retry := 5 // TODO`. | 🟡 |
| 6049 | `OpenURL` | `// TODO: signlink.openurl for applets not included` — Go isn't an applet; remove the TODO. | ⚪ |
| 6101 | `RunFlames` | `// TODO: try/catch` — flame anim error handling. | ⚪ |
| 6172 | `LoginFunc` | `// TODO: try/catch` — wrap login in a recover/log. | 🟡 |
| 6976 | `GetCodeBase` | `// TODO: getcodebase signlink - signlink.mainapp` — replace with config-driven host. | 🟡 |
| 7224 | `UpdateInterfaceAnimation` | `// TODO: verify or` — operator precedence check. | ⚪ |
| 7747 | (commented) | `//func (c *Client) GetParameter(...)` — applet HTML parameters; not applicable to Go. Delete with a one-line comment. | ⚪ |
| 7863 | `BuildScene` | `// TODO: try/catch` — IO error from cache read. | ⚪ |
| 7986 | `ExecuteClientscript1` | `// TODO: try/catch`. | ⚪ |
| 8079 | `DrawError` | Entire function is `// TODO: stub`. Needed if connection/login fails visibly. | 🟡 |
| 8731 | `GetPlayerExtended2` | `// TODO: try/catch`. | ⚪ |

### 4.4 GameShell / input / pixmap gaps

| File:Line | Function | Gap | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `client/gameshell.go:22–24` | `InitApplication` | `DrawArea` link to window component; window open timing. | 🟡 |
| `client/gameshell.go:38` | `InitApplication` | `go app.Main() // TODO: go?` — pattern for the Gio main goroutine. | 🟡 |
| `client/gameshell.go:86` | (event loop) | `// TODO: listeners` — keyboard/mouse event listeners not attached. | 🔴 |
| `client/gameshell.go:168` | `PollKey` | `return 0 // TODO: stub` — never returns a real key. | 🔴 |
| `client/gameshell.go:172` | `DrawProgress` | `// TODO: stub` — progress UI during cache load. | 🟡 |
| `client/inputtracking/inputtracking.go:20` | (package) | `// TODO: all funcs synchronized` — concurrent access from event goroutine and game loop. | 🟡 |
| `client/viewbox.go:10–14` | `ViewBox` | Whole struct is a stub. | 🟡 |
| `graphics/pixmap/pixmap.go:18` | (file) | `// TODO` — pipeline orientation comment, may be vestigial. | ⚪ |
| `graphics/pixmap/pixmap.go:45` | `NewPixMap` | `image.NewRGBA(...) // TODO: unused` — may be dead allocation now that `convertPixmapPixels` uses NRGBA (commit f1eca00). | ⚪ |
| `graphics/pixmap/pixmap.go:62–63` | `Draw` | Concurrent `ops.Ops` access concern. The `DrawMu` mutex was added later (`CLAUDE.md`) — verify these TODOs are now stale. | 🟡 |

### 4.5 Lower-priority verification TODOs

These are all `// TODO: verify`-style markers from the original translation
pass. None are blockers; each is a small, isolated correctness check against
the Java source. Tracked here so the list isn't lost.

- `pkg/jagex2/datastruct/lrucache.go:14` — `HashTable: make(map[int64]T, 0x400) // TODO: not limited to 0x400`
- `pkg/jagex2/datastruct/jstring/jstring.go:51` — return of fixed-size builder slice
- `pkg/jagex2/io/bzip2/bzip2.go` lines 15, 141, 384, 418, 515, 549, 578 — several `byte ↔ int` conversion markers
- `pkg/jagex2/graphics/pix32/pix32.go:37–72` — five markers, mostly applet `MediaTracker` / `PixelGrabber` and pixel type
- `pkg/jagex2/graphics/pix3d/pix3d.go:280` — color packing arithmetic
- `pkg/jagex2/graphics/model/model.go:259,264` — possibly-nil return where Java would return an empty Model
- `pkg/jagex2/wordenc/wordpack/wordpack.go:59,64` — slice bounds and `80` truncation
- `pkg/jagex2/config/component/component.go:182,224,233` — string parsing in `Unpack`
- `pkg/jagex2/dash3d/world/world.go:289,598` — coord swap and bit shift conversion
- `pkg/jagex2/dash3d/entity/pathingentity.go:153` — virtual-dispatch pattern (interface vs. embedded method)
- `pkg/jagex2/sound/wave/wave.go:138` — signed-byte bitwise AND
- `pkg/jagex2/config/loctype/loctype.go:213`, `pkg/jagex2/config/npctype/npctype.go:35` — `*string` vs `string` for optional ops

### 4.6 Signlink-specific notes

Verified state of `pkg/sign/signlink/signlink.go` (the Go side is started in a
goroutine from `cmd/client/main.go`, so `Run()` doesn't deadlock the caller —
that was a false alarm):

- ✅ `DNSLookup` matches Java semantics (sets `dns` to the request before the
  background goroutine resolves it).
- ✅ `CacheLoad`, `CacheSave`, `WaveSave`, `MidiSave` all match the Java
  polling protocol.
- ~~🔴 `OpenSocket` (Java `opensocket`) is completely absent; `Run()` clears
  `SocketReq` without ever creating a connection (lines 71–74).~~ **Ported
  2026-05-21** — `OpenSocket(port int) (net.Conn, error)` dials
  `clientextras.Host:port` directly (10s timeout); `SocketReq` and the
  `Run()` branch are gone.
- 🟡 `OpenURL` returns `[]byte` instead of a streaming reader. Acceptable as a
  simplification, but callers in `client.go` may need adjusting if any stream
  the bytes lazily.
- 🟡 Spin-waits in `CacheLoad`, `CacheSave`, `OpenURL` (`for X != "" { time.Sleep(...) }`)
  are functionally correct under the single-polling-goroutine model but
  unprotected by any memory-barrier primitive. A small `sync.Mutex` or
  channel-based request/response pattern would be more correct; this is
  worth doing once but doesn't block any single feature.
- ⚪ `// TODO: synchronized` markers correspond to Java's `synchronized`
  methods. Most are redundant because the polling goroutine is the only
  writer; document this and remove the markers where applicable.

## 5. Execution Plan

Phases run in dependency order. Each phase ends with `go build ./...` and
`go test ./...` clean, and a commit per logical step.

### Phase 1 — Networking transport (unblocks login)

**Goal:** A logged-in client can exchange packets with a local server.

1. ~~Port `jagex2/io/ClientStream.java` → `pkg/jagex2/io/clientstream/clientstream.go`.~~
   - ~~Wrap `net.Conn` with `bufio.Reader` for `read()`, `read(buf, off, len)`,
     `available()`. Use a 5000-byte ring buffer + writer goroutine for
     `write()`, mirroring Java's `buf/bufPos/bufLen` exactly.~~
   - ~~Provide `Close()` that cancels the writer goroutine via a context or
     channel and closes the conn. Avoid Java's `synchronized` + `notify()`
     pattern — use a buffered channel or `sync.Cond`.~~
   - ~~Tests: round-trip bytes via `net.Pipe()`.~~
   - **Done 2026-05-21.** Used `sync.Cond` (closer line-by-line to Java than
     a channel). `atomic.Bool` for `closed` so lockless reads in `Read` /
     `Available` don't race with `Close`. Tests cover round-trip, offset/length
     argument order, EOF semantics, `Close` unblocking a blocked reader,
     `Close` idempotency, write-after-close, and multi-write drain. `go test
     -race` clean.
2. ~~Implement `signlink.OpenSocket(port int) (net.Conn, error)`.~~
   - ~~Since Go isn't sandboxed like a signed applet, skip the request/response
     polling pattern entirely: dial directly and return the conn. Document the
     deviation from the Java protocol in a comment.~~
   - **Done 2026-05-21.** `net.DialTimeout("tcp", host:port, 10s)` against
     `clientextras.Host` (new field, defaults `"127.0.0.1"`). Removed
     `SocketReq` global, the `if SocketReq != 0` branch in `Run()`, and the
     `//Socket // TODO` placeholder. Tests cover round-trip + connect-refused.
3. ~~Add `Client.OpenSocket(port int) (net.Conn, error)` matching Java's
   `client.openSocket(int)` — currently always uses the signlink path since
   `signlink.mainapp` is always nil in Go.~~
   - **Done 2026-05-21.** Body delegates to `signlink.OpenSocket(port)`; the
     Java `signlink.mainapp == null` ternary collapses since Go is always
     standalone. No current Go callers (all `// TODO: clientstream` in
     `LoginFunc`/`TryReconnect`); wiring deferred to steps 4-7.
4. Add `Stream *clientstream.ClientStream` field to `Client`. Uncomment
   `//Stream ClientStream // TODO` at `client.go:483`.
5. Wire `LoginFunc` (client.go:6170+) end-to-end: create the stream, write
   login bytes, read the response byte, dispatch the switch. Drop the
   placeholder `var7 := 0`.
6. Wire `Logout`, `Unload`, `TryReconnect`, and the heartbeat write
   (client.go:6938) to actually call `c.Stream.Write` / `Close`.
7. Port the inbound packet dispatcher in `Read()` (client.go:8623). This is
   the largest single function still stubbed (~100 lines in Java); break it
   into one PR per opcode group if it gets unwieldy.
8. Replace the `GetHost` stub at client.go:4865 with a config-driven host
   (CLI arg → `clientextras.Host`, falling back to `127.0.0.1`).

### Phase 2 — Input wiring (unblocks playable UI)

1. Port `gameshell.go:86` event listeners — Gio key/mouse events → the existing
   `inputtracking` package.
2. Implement `PollKey` (`gameshell.go:168`) returning the next queued key.
3. Add a small `sync.Mutex` to `inputtracking` to remove the `// TODO: synchronized`.
4. Resolve the pixmap concurrency TODOs (`pixmap.go:62–63`) — confirm `DrawMu`
   coverage and delete stale markers.

### Phase 3 — Audio handoff

1. Replace MIDI-sync TODOs (`client.go:656`, `client.go:1533`, and field at
   `client.go:595`) with a single-element buffered channel between the
   loader and the playback goroutine. Document this as the Go equivalent of
   the Java `synchronized` / `wait` / `notify` pattern.

### Phase 4 — Missing utility types

1. Port `jagex2/datastruct/HashTable.java` → `pkg/jagex2/datastruct/hashtable/`.
   Audit callers in `client.go` and config types; some may currently use the
   Go built-in `map` where Java used `HashTable` and need updating.
2. Decide whether `ViewBox` is worth a literal port or whether it can be
   replaced by a Gio-native equivalent (the Java version is AWT-derived).
   Document the decision inline.

### Phase 5 — Error reporting & cleanup

1. Implement `DrawError` (`client.go:8079`).
2. Sweep `// TODO: try/catch` markers: convert to idiomatic Go errors at
   boundaries, delete the rest with a one-line comment per Java site.
3. Strip applet-only TODOs (`signlink.openurl for applets`, `GetParameter`,
   `signlink.mainapp` checks) and document in code comments why they don't
   apply.
4. Work through §4.5 verification TODOs in batches by package.

### Phase 6 — Hardening

1. Spin-wait → channel/mutex conversion in `signlink`.
2. Race-detector run: `go test -race ./...`.
3. Optional: add Java-side cross-check tests for any complex algorithm
   (model rendering, bzip2, ISAAC) that already has TODOs flagged.

## 6. Conventions for Updating This File

- Mark items 🔴 / 🟡 / ⚪ as you go; strike them through (`~~text~~`) when
  landed, then prune in a periodic cleanup.
- When a new gap is discovered that doesn't fit an existing bucket, add it
  to §4 with a file:line reference and a one-line description.
- When the phase plan in §5 changes (e.g. a step turns out to depend on
  something not anticipated), revise the order rather than leaving stale
  steps in place.
- Commit message convention: prefix porting work with `port:` (e.g.
  `port: ClientStream + signlink.OpenSocket`), separate from `Bug fixes` /
  `Renaming` style commits already in the log.
